# The Municipal Innovations INSTITUTE

This is a brand new leadership and innovations thinktank for INDEPENDENT thinkers who want to help trasform municipalites to become living, breathing and active centres for social innovation.

The new trend is to uncomplicate what we are over-complicating, to simplify what we are made so confusing and over-managed and under led, that we had no choice than to INNOVATE and IDEATE and INTUITIVELY RE-INVENT what cities do and how they work.

We will launch a 6 tier education program to support leaders who want to and are willing to admit the systems today need improvements and we need to better serve and protect the people and planet we are all here to do together. 

A blog - 
A youtube channel with educational tips and tricks
A workshop series on next gen leadership development skills and habits and more. 

We are creating the future by creating the next generation of leaders and innovators and intrapreneurs and inter-connected resources of the future networks of brand new, built from the ground up municipal and governmental services delivery models of the future. 

AI-assisted systems improvements and systems based models of the future, plus, a new and improved Human and Technology resources department of the future that uses the best resources and the best people for the job at hand, to be trained and ready when needed, to serve and protect the people and planet, while making the lives and improving the lifestyles of all those who sahre our air, water, food, communities and planet. 
"We are in this together, so, let's work together to make things better."
